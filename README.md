# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-System

This project aims to build a personalized movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the collaborative filtering approach of Machine Learning, we predict user-specific movie ratings and generate top-N movie recommendations. The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, trains a model using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from the Surprise library.
